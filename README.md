Movie Recommendation System
Overview:
This project is a Movie Recommendation System that suggests movies based on user preferences, ratings, and other data. The system is designed to provide personalized recommendations, enhancing the movie-watching experience for users. It leverages modern recommendation techniques, including Collaborative Filtering and Content-Based Filtering, to generate accurate and meaningful suggestions.

## Features
Personalized Recommendations: Tailored movie suggestions based on user input and historical data.
## Recommendation Techniques: 
## Implements:
Collaborative Filtering to identify patterns based on user ratings.
Content-Based Filtering to suggest movies similar to those a user has already enjoyed.
## Hybrid Approach: 
Combines both techniques for improved accuracy.
## Scalable Design: 
Can handle large datasets of movies and user ratings.
## Interactive Interface: 
(If applicable) A user-friendly interface to explore movie recommendations.

## How It Works
Dataset: The system uses movie and user rating datasets to build a recommendation model. (E.g., MovieLens dataset).
Preprocessing: The data is cleaned and transformed to create a user-item matrix or content-based features.
Model: The recommendation system predicts movies for users using one or more algorithms (e.g., Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), cosine similarity, etc.).
Output: Users receive a list of top-rated or most relevant movie suggestions.

## Tech Stack
Programming Language: Python
Libraries: Pandas, NumPy (data manipulation)
Scikit-learn (modeling and similarity)
Surprise (collaborative filtering algorithms)
Matplotlib, Seaborn
Streamlit/Flask (optional: for interactive UI)

## Input Example
Provide a list of movies the user likes, and the system will generate recommendations based on those preferences.

## Dataset
This system uses publicly available datasets, such as the MovieLens dataset. If the dataset is not included, you can download it from the provided link and place it in the dataset/ folder.

## Results
The system outputs a ranked list of movies with their predicted ratings, allowing users to discover new movies matching their tastes.

## Example Output
For a user who likes "Inception" and "The Matrix," the system might recommend:

Interstellar
Blade Runner 2049
The Dark Knight
Minority Report
The Prestige

## Future Improvements
Adding real-time data updates for dynamic recommendations.
Expanding to include TV shows or other entertainment options.
Building a web-based or mobile-friendly UI for easy access.
